WebSQL - asynchronous and fast connector to mysql

WebSQL is an asynchronous interface to the popular MySQL_ database server for Python based on webscalesql.
The design goals are:
- Compatibility with Python3 asyncio package
- Compatibility with WebScale fork of MySQL
- Compliance with Python database API version 2.0 [PEP-0249]_
- Thread-safety
- Thread-friendliness (threads will not block each other)
MySQL-5.5 and newer and Python-3.4 and newer are currently supported.
WebSQL is `Free Software`_.
