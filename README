WebSQL - asynchronous and fast connector to mysql

WebSQL is an asynchronous python connector to the popular MySQL_ database server based on WebScaleSQL_.
The design goals are:
    - Compatibility with Python3 asyncio package
    - Compliance with Python database API version 2.0 [PEP-0249]_
    - Thread-safety
    - Thread-friendliness (threads will not block each other)

MySQL-5.5 and newer and Python-3.4 and newer are currently supported.

WebSQL is `Free Software`_.
